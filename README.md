# Newspaperlike - A light theme for the old man in all of us

Newspaperlike is a light theme that is heavilyt inspired by, you guessed it, newspapers. It does little to aide visibility/readability other than to present code in different shades of grey.

Maybe you think it looks cool. Maybe you'll just keep it around for aesthetic 'gram pics of your code. Maybe you'll actually find it useful for some odd purpose. In any case, I'm having fun making this, so I don't mind.

If something is terribly unreadable, please leave a comment informing me and I will change it ASAP.
